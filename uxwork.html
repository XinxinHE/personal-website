            <h3>Ambient Game Building</h3>
            <p>This is an amazing tool that allows you to create artworks quickly with typing. With your keyboard and your favorite colors, you can build your customized pictures within less than five minutes. There are several potential uses: designing slide background, designing simplified cartoon character, communicating novelly on social media, etc.</p>

            <p>TypeNinjia is a mid-air typing method with Leap Motion for large displays. We firstly surveyed the possible input modalities for our project. Then, we evaluated these modalities based on which we designed our optimal keyboard layout. To better demonstrate our design, we come up with a potential use of the keyboard on large displays - a restaurant aid system in the airport.</p>

              <h3>Usability Evaluation for Chegg</h3>
              <p>We mainly test the functions of selling and buying textbooks, looking for course info, and leaving comments. We took walkthrough, hueristic evaluation, and user test for these functions. During user test, we asked users to finish several tasks with think-aloud method. Then we reviewed their performances and collected feedbacks, and compiled a report for better design.</p>

              <h3>Housemate - An aide for people with engaged hands</h3>
              <p>Housemate is an app that will run on large-format touch-capable displays, and will have interface modules designed to perform specific tasks. Housemate is designed to let users have access to media while their hands are engaged. Users may be at a greater distance from screen, with no hands or only their non-dominant hand to interact, and may glance at the screen only periodically.</p>

              <h3>Wildwood night - A interactive storybook for children</h3>
              <p>The goal of my project is to provide pleasure for kids. Researches show that kids can be easily attracted by animation, cartoon figure, and they absorb more from those medias than purely descriptive text. Therefore, I developed a digital book with mixed media wishing to stimulate their interest and help them to learn more.</p>

            <p>TypeNinjia is a mid-air typing method with Leap motion for large displays. We firstly surveyed various keyboard layouts and mid-air gestures for wall-sized screens, finding out the possible input modalities for our project. Then, we evaluated these modalities based on which we designed our optimal keyboard layout. To better demonstrate our design, we come up with a potential use of the keyboard on large displays - a restaurant aid system in the airport. </p>
