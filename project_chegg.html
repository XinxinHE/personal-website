				<h1>Usability Evaluation for Chegg</h1>
				<p>Chegg is an online student hub that buys and sells used textbooks, provides course information of different schools, searches matched scholarships, and offers tutors for school homework. The main users of Chegg are students at or above high schools. </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Site Map</h3>
            <p >We generated the Site Map firstly. The Site Map offers a visual representation of the information space of the website, and it is a supplement to the primary navigation. With the Site Map, we can have an overview of the site's areas in a single glance; as the picture on the left shows, Chegg is built with several levels of hierarchy each of which displays a group of features, appearances, and names. </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
            <p style="float:left; width:400px;">Firstly, We picked four major services from Site Map: purchase used textbooks, sell used textbooks to Chegg, check course information, and find solutions for exercises in textbooks. Then, We created four scenarios (include user demographic info, the goal he/she wants to accomplish with the service, and the steps he/she takes to accomplish the goal) for each of the services and extracted user tasks and sub-tasks for future user tests. Later, we invited three UX experts to do expert reviews based on the tasks we extracted. Experts used think-aloud methods while going through the tasks, telling us which element violated design principles, which element is intuitive. All three tests were videotaped. Finally, we summarized and prioritized the findings.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            <p style="float:left; width:400px;">Firstly, We listed all the web pages needed by the four services above in order. Then we invited three expert to do heuristic evaluation based on Nielson's ten usability heuristics. What they did were going through all the pages, indentifying potential usability problems and speaking them out aloud. Finally, we categorized all the findings by priorities and usability heuristics. </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">User Tests</h3>
            <p style="float:left; width:400px;">We recruited seven participants to do user tests on Chegg. At first, we greeted our users and tried to make them as comfortable as possible. We then handed out them the consent form and helped them go through it; the consent form introduced briefly the goal and process of this test, user right to stop. After signing the content form, the test officialy started. We asked users to answer some preliminary questions - questions that surveyed their demographic information and experience of ordering textbooks and finding book solutions online. Then a series of tasks were introduces and users were supposed to complete them in order. During the task completing process, one team member served as the question-asker and task-explainer, other group members took notes of some key points and user behaviors. Finally the test ended with some closing questions and a SUS(system usability scale) questionnaire. As you can see, the average score of SUS of Chegg is 49.6 that is below the standard average score 68. However, the best way to analyze the score result is to normalize the score.</p>
