            <h3>Time Management Research</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project is to study how people sense their time and how technology can help improve the productivity of their days. In this study, we will be collecting four sets of user data: plan sheet, review sheet, laptop log, experience survey. With those data, we wish to discover the secret of human time rythmn and its dependency on technology.</p>

                    <p>We used all of the principles of User Experience Design to come up with a very innovative and exciting application. From Conceptualization through Sketching and High Fidelity prototypes we were able to change the way we think about social interaction.</p>

            <h3>TypeNinjia - A mid-air typing method for large displays</h3>
            <p>TypeNinjia is a mid-air typing method with Leap motion for large displays. We firstly surveyed the possible input modalities for our project. Then, we evaluated these modalities based on which we designed our optimal keyboard layout. To better demonstrate our design, we come up with a potential use of the keyboard on large displays - a restaurant aid system in the airport.</p>

            <h3>Usability Evaluation for Chegg</h3>
            <p>We mainly test the functions of selling and buying textbooks, looking for course info, and leaving comments. We took walkthrough, hueristic evaluation, and user test for these functions. During user test, we asked users to finish several tasks with think-aloud method. Then we reviewed their performances and collected feedbacks, and compiled a report for better design.</p>

            <h3>Secret Diary - </h3>
            <p>TypeNinjia is a mid-air typing method with Leap motion for large displays. We firstly surveyed various keyboard layouts and mid-air gestures for wall-sized screens, finding out the possible input modalities for our project. Then, we evaluated these modalities based on which we designed our optimal keyboard layout. To better demonstrate our design, we come up with a potential use of the keyboard on large displays - a restaurant aid system in the airport. </p>
